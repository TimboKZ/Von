🖼️🤔 Node.js generator for (static) single page galleries. The default template is responsive and supports lazy loading.
Available as a CommonJS module and as a command line tool.

Ever wanted to make a single page gallery of all of the pics you had? Well, now you can!

# Usage

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), which will automatically install NPM. Then, install Von globally:

```bash
npm install -g von-gallery
```

Now go into any folder on your computer with some images (make sure it's not too big) and simply run:

```bash
von
```

This will create an `index.html` with a gallery of all of the images in your directory. 

> Von has many more features, including `vonrc.js` config. I'll add more documentation and examples once these features
are stable.
